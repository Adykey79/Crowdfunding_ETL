**Brief Description**: This group project comprises four separate sections to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions:
> - *Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames* - Extract and transform the input *crowdfunding xls* sheet based on requirements.
> - *Part 2: Create the Campaign DataFrame* - Extract and transform the input *crowdfunding xls* sheet to create a campaign dataframe.
> - *Part 3: Create the Contacts DataFrame* - Extract and transform data from the input *contacts.xls* sheet using one of the Python dictionary or regular expression methods.
> - *Part 4: Create the Crowdfunding Database* - Using QuickDBD, create a crowdfunding database ERD and a related Postgres DB and perform validation of the tables.<br>

**Inputs**: The challenge takes in as input two XLS files each containing the crowdfunding and contacts data. This is uploaded into the folder titled *Resources*.<br>

**Outputs**: The challenge provides the following outputs for each of the different activities.
> - *Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames*: Two separate dataframes that show each of the category and sub-category data elements.    
> - *Part 2: Create the Campaign DataFrame*: A separate dataframe that includes all the relevant campaign data elements based on the extracted *crowdfunding.xls* file above. 
> - *Part 3: Create the Contacts DataFrame*: A separate dataframe that includes all the relevant contacts data elements based on the extracted *contacts.xls* file above.
> - *Part 4: Create the Crowdfunding Database*: Crowdfunding database ERD in QuickDBD along with a related Postgres DB that imports each CSV file into its own table.
